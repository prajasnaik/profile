## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Resume Data (resume.json)

The website content is driven by a JSON file located at `src/data/resume.json`. This file contains all your personal information, skills, projects, and other details.

#### File Structure

```json
{
  "personalInfo": {
    "name": "Your Full Name",
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "phone": "+1 (555) 123-4567",
    "location": "Your City, Country",
    "website": "https://yourwebsite.com",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",
    "github": "https://github.com/yourusername"
  },
  "background": {
    "introduction": "Brief introduction about yourself",

  },
  "skills": [
    {
      "category": "Category Name",
      "items": ["Skill 1", "Skill 2", "Skill 3"]
    }
  ],

      "github": "https://github.com/username/project"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Configuration Steps:

1. **Update Personal Information**: Replace the placeholder values in `personalInfo` with your actual details
2. **Write Your Background**: Craft compelling introduction and summary texts
3. **List Your Skills**: Organize skills into relevant categories
4. **Add Projects**: Include your key projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links
5. **Save the File**: The website will automatically reflect changes when you refresh

2. Name it appropriately (`profile-photo.jpg`)
3. The image will be automatically referenced in the resume display

### Resume PDF

2. Name it `resume.pdf` (this is the expected filename)
3. The website includes a download link that points to this file

## üé® Customization

### Theme Customization

The entire UI theme can be customized by modifying the CSS custom properties in `src/app/globals.css`. The file uses CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for consistent theming.

#### Key Theme Variables:

```css
:root {
  /* Light theme colors */
  --background: oklch(1 0 0); /* Main background */
  --foreground: oklch(0.2101 0.0318 264.6645); /* Text color */
  --primary: oklch(0.6716 0.1368 48.513); /* Primary accent */
  --secondary: oklch(0.536 0.0398 196.028); /* Secondary accent */
  --muted: oklch(0.967 0.0029 264.5419); /* Muted backgrounds */
  --border: oklch(0.9276 0.0058 264.5313); /* Border colors */
  /* ... additional variables */
}
```

#### Dark Theme Variables:

```css
.dark {
  /* Dark theme overrides */
  --background: oklch(0.2101 0.0318 264.6645);
  --foreground: oklch(1 0 0);
  /* ... dark theme variables */
}
```

#### Customization Steps:

1. Open `src/app/globals.css`
2. Modify the CSS custom properties to match your desired color scheme
3. Use [oklch color space](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch) for better color control
4. Test changes in both light and dark modes
5. The theme toggle will automatically apply your custom colors

### Typography

The website uses custom font variables that can be modified:

```css
--font-sans: Geist Mono, ui-monospace, monospace;
--font-serif: serif;
--font-mono: JetBrains Mono, monospace;
```
